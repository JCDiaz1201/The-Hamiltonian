          <p>The year 2016 will be remembered not just for the departure of England from the European Union(EU) or the election of Donald J. Trump(a reality television star and billionaire) to the Presidency of The United States. The year 2016 will also be remembered as the year the Post Cold-War epoch, and by extension the Cold-War epoch, drew to a close.</p>

          <p>The world now faces an era, fluid, and unpredictable. Relations between The Great Powers has become unbalanced, fraught with tension and mistrust. The world economy faces uncertainty, the return of protectionism, and widespread stagnation. The internal constitution of states face new and unique pressures brought about by advances in technology and the advent of social media. In the most extreme scenarios the notion of the modern Nation-State may even be questioned and overturned.</p>

          <p>The United States will be beset by trends somewhat within her control, and mega-trends largely outside of her control, all the while operating within the coursing currents of her and the world’s history. We here at The Hamiltonian seek to aid her in this journey in writing and analysis. No doubt the United States is at a crossroads, a junction in history, and in the coming decades the question of who and what she is will be asked, debated, and answered. We hope to shape those coming debates in a constructive and positive manner.</p>

          <p>Our ultimate goal is to help the country become what she has always aspired to be: a more perfect union, a shining city on a hill; and place the country in a position to decide her fate vis-à-vis the world. We know the task before us is immense, daunting even; but it is not a task we will shirk from. Our hat is in the ring and we intend to fight till the bitter end, come victory or defeat.</p>
