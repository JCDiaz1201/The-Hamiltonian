Getting Started
---------------

Open your command prompt

Switch to the directory containing the application

In the command prompt type "rake db:setup" and press enter

Once that is through type "rails server" to run the server

At this point open your internet browser and type in "http://localhost:[What ever port number your computer assigns]"
	
	-In my case it is located on port 3000 so I enter: "http://localhost:3000"

And bam! You're set! You should be able to view my app in all its glory.

Hope you enjoy!
